## Project Overview
[The INDRA Project, sponsored by Alt Surya Inc., aims to develop a prototype predictive software system for early warning of cloudbursts in urban areas. Leveraging machine learning and time series analysis, the project will integrate multiple datasets, including NOAA and FEMA data, to predict cloudburst occurrences within a 6-hour window and estimate their intensity and potential impact. The goal is to improve current prediction accuracy, which remains below 50% in target locations, enhancing disaster preparedness for communities and businesses.]
